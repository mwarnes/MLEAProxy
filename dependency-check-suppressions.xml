        OWASP Dependency Check Suppressions for MLEAProxy

        This is a TESTING AND DIAGNOSTIC tool only - not for production use.
        Some vulnerabilities are acceptable for a development/testing tool.

        Suppress only well-documented false positives or vulnerabilities that:
        1. Do not apply to testing/diagnostic use cases
        2. Are in test-only dependencies
        3. Are verified false positives with the library vendor

        Review and update this file periodically as new CVEs are discovered.

    <!-- Example suppression (remove if not needed):
    <suppress>
        <notes><![CDATA[
        False positive: CVE does not affect this usage pattern in a testing tool
        ]]></notes>
        <packageUrl regex="true">^pkg:maven/org\.example/library@.*$</packageUrl>
        <cve>CVE-XXXX-XXXXX</cve>
    </suppress>
