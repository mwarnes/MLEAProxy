## Script 1: extract-jwks-simple.sh

### Purpose
Extracts RSA public keys from JWKS endpoints, converts them to PEM format, and uploads them to MarkLogic External Security profiles. Includes intelligent duplicate detection to prevent adding existing keys.

### Usage Syntax
```bash
./extract-jwks-simple.sh <JWKS_ENDPOINT_URL> [--upload-to-marklogic]
```

### Parameters
- **`<JWKS_ENDPOINT_URL>`** (required) - The HTTPS/HTTP URL of the JWKS endpoint
- **`--upload-to-marklogic`** (optional) - Uploads keys to MarkLogic (analysis only without this flag)

### Examples

#### Basic Key Extraction (Analysis Only)
```bash
# Extract and display keys without uploading
./extract-jwks-simple.sh https://auth.example.com/.well-known/jwks.json
```

**Output:**
```
DCYjkxqf7xLskUc_9tlaJ8-2QC4Vx-G1nPC1qPQro1Q
-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8AMIIBCgKCAQEAuekhsx8JZydBcsINa2Gt...
-----END PUBLIC KEY-----

9xJihMI2qDH9Aon014odONQLByhF553_8Wu_zcM2StM
-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8AMIIBCgKCAQEA8I5S+2YnzUeYsV0K0b8A...
-----END PUBLIC KEY-----
```

#### Upload New Keys to MarkLogic
```bash
# Extract and upload new keys (skips duplicates)
./extract-jwks-simple.sh https://auth.example.com/.well-known/jwks.json --upload-to-marklogic
```

**Output with Duplicate Detection:**
```
üîç Checking existing keys in MarkLogic External Security profile 'OAUTH2-Keycloak'...
üìä Found 2 existing key(s) in MarkLogic:
   - DCYjkxqf7xLskUc_9tlaJ8-2QC4Vx-G1nPC1qPQro1Q
   - 9xJihMI2qDH9Aon014odONQLByhF553_8Wu_zcM2StM

‚è≠Ô∏è  Key 'DCYjkxqf7xLskUc_9tlaJ8-2QC4Vx-G1nPC1qPQro1Q' already exists in MarkLogic - skipping
‚úÖ Key 'NewKeyId123' is new - will be added to MarkLogic

üîÑ Preparing to upload 1 new key(s) to MarkLogic...

## Script 2: cleanup-obsolete-jwks-keys.sh

### Purpose
Compares keys in MarkLogic External Security profiles with current JWKS endpoints to identify and optionally remove obsolete keys that are no longer active.

### Usage Syntax
```bash
./cleanup-obsolete-jwks-keys.sh <JWKS_ENDPOINT_URL> [--delete-keys]
```

### Parameters
- **`<JWKS_ENDPOINT_URL>`** (required) - The HTTPS/HTTP URL of the JWKS endpoint
- **`--delete-keys`** (optional) - Actually removes obsolete keys (analysis only without this flag)

### Two-Step Workflow

#### Step 1: Analysis Mode (Safe)
```bash
# Identify obsolete keys without making changes
./cleanup-obsolete-jwks-keys.sh https://auth.example.com/.well-known/jwks.json
```

**Sample Output:**
```
üîç JWKS Key Cleanup Analysis

üßπ Cleanup Options:
   4. To delete obsolete keys, run:
      ./cleanup-obsolete-jwks-keys.sh https://auth.example.com/.well-known/jwks.json --delete-keys
```

#### Step 2: Deletion Mode (Destructive)
```bash
# Remove obsolete keys with confirmation
./cleanup-obsolete-jwks-keys.sh https://auth.example.com/.well-known/jwks.json --delete-keys
```

**Interactive Deletion Process:**
```
‚ö†Ô∏è  DELETE MODE ENABLED - Obsolete keys will be removed from MarkLogic!

üóëÔ∏è  DELETING OBSOLETE KEYS
==========================

## Configuration

### MarkLogic Settings
Both scripts use hardcoded MarkLogic configuration. Modify these variables in the scripts if needed:

```bash
# MarkLogic configuration (edit in both scripts)
MARKLOGIC_HOST="your-marklogic-server.com"
MARKLOGIC_PORT="8002"
MARKLOGIC_USER="admin"
MARKLOGIC_PASS="your-admin-password"
EXTERNAL_SECURITY_NAME="Your-External-Security-Profile"
```

**Configuration Parameters:**
- **MARKLOGIC_HOST**: MarkLogic server hostname or IP address
- **MARKLOGIC_PORT**: Management API port (typically 8002)
- **MARKLOGIC_USER**: Admin username with External Security permissions
- **MARKLOGIC_PASS**: Admin password
- **EXTERNAL_SECURITY_NAME**: Name of the External Security profile

### SSL Certificate Handling
Both scripts include SSL certificate bypass for development environments with self-signed certificates. The `-k` flag is used with curl commands.

**For Production**: Remove the `-k` flag and ensure proper SSL certificates are configured.

## Workflows and Best Practices

### Complete Key Lifecycle Management

#### 1. Initial Setup
```bash
# First time: Extract and upload all current keys
./extract-jwks-simple.sh https://your-idp.com/jwks --upload-to-marklogic
```

#### 2. Key Rotation Handling
```bash
# After IdP key rotation: Add new keys (automatic duplicate detection)
./extract-jwks-simple.sh https://your-idp.com/jwks --upload-to-marklogic

# Clean up old keys: Analyze first
./cleanup-obsolete-jwks-keys.sh https://your-idp.com/jwks

# Clean up old keys: Delete after verification
./cleanup-obsolete-jwks-keys.sh https://your-idp.com/jwks --delete-keys
```

#### 3. Scheduled Maintenance
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Example maintenance script (maintenance.sh)
JWKS_URL="https://your-idp.com/jwks"

echo "=== Key Synchronization Maintenance ==="
echo "Adding new keys..."
./extract-jwks-simple.sh "$JWKS_URL" --upload-to-marklogic

echo "Analyzing obsolete keys..."
./cleanup-obsolete-jwks-keys.sh "$JWKS_URL"

echo "=== Maintenance Complete ==="
```

### Key Rotation Best Practices

#### Grace Period Considerations
When rotating keys, consider the following timeline:
1. **T+0**: New key published in JWKS
2. **T+0**: Add new key to MarkLogic (using extract script)
3. **T+24h**: Applications begin using new key for signing
4. **T+72h**: Analyze for obsolete keys (using cleanup script)
5. **T+168h (1 week)**: Remove obsolete keys after ensuring no old tokens remain

#### Verification Steps
Before deleting obsolete keys:
1. **Check Token Expiry**: Ensure all tokens signed with old keys have expired
2. **Application Testing**: Verify applications work with current key set
3. **Monitoring**: Check for JWT validation errors in application logs
4. **Backup**: Consider backing up MarkLogic configuration before deletion

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. Connection Errors
**Problem**: `Failed to fetch JWKS data from endpoint`
```bash
# Check network connectivity
curl -I https://your-idp.com/jwks

# Test with verbose output
curl -v https://your-idp.com/jwks
```

**Solutions:**
- Verify URL is correct and accessible
- Check firewall/proxy settings
- Ensure SSL certificates are valid (or use -k for testing)

#### 2. MarkLogic Authentication Errors
**Problem**: `XDMP-OAUTH: Access token provided is empty`
```bash
# Test MarkLogic connectivity
curl -u admin:password http://marklogic-host:8002/manage/v2/external-security
```

**Solutions:**
- Verify MarkLogic credentials in script configuration
- Ensure admin user has External Security permissions
- Check MarkLogic server is running and accessible

#### 3. JSON Parsing Errors
**Problem**: `Invalid JSON response from JWKS endpoint`
```bash
# Validate JWKS response manually
curl https://your-idp.com/jwks | jq .
```

**Solutions:**
- Verify JWKS endpoint returns valid JSON
- Check for HTML error pages instead of JSON
- Ensure endpoint is the correct JWKS URL

#### 4. Key Format Issues
**Problem**: Keys not converting to PEM format
```bash
# Check if required tools are available
which openssl python3
```

**Solutions:**
- Install missing dependencies (openssl, python3)
- Verify RSA key parameters (n, e) are present in JWKS
- Check for unsupported key types (only RSA keys are uploaded)

#### 5. Permission Issues
**Problem**: Script execution permission denied
```bash
# Make scripts executable
chmod +x extract-jwks-simple.sh
chmod +x cleanup-obsolete-jwks-keys.sh
```

### Debug Mode
For troubleshooting, you can modify the scripts to add debug output:

```bash
# Add to beginning of script for verbose output
set -x  # Enable debug mode
```

## Security Considerations

### Key Management Security
1. **Principle of Least Privilege**: Use dedicated service accounts with minimal required permissions
2. **Credential Protection**: Store MarkLogic credentials securely (consider environment variables)
3. **Audit Logging**: Monitor all key addition/deletion operations
4. **Network Security**: Use HTTPS for all communications
5. **Access Control**: Restrict script execution to authorized personnel

### Production Deployment Security
```bash
# Example: Using environment variables for credentials
export MARKLOGIC_USER="service-account"
export MARKLOGIC_PASS="secure-password"
export MARKLOGIC_HOST="your-marklogic-server.com"

# Modify script to use environment variables
MARKLOGIC_USER="${MARKLOGIC_USER:-admin}"
MARKLOGIC_PASS="${MARKLOGIC_PASS:-admin}"
```

### Key Validation
Before deleting keys, always verify:
- No active JWT tokens are signed with the key
- Applications have been updated to use new keys
- Sufficient grace period has passed for token expiration
